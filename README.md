# Lab 9 - Quiz and Hackathon

Lab opens with a quiz and then kicks off the hackathon.

To get the full point for the lab, you need to pass Tasks 1-3 during the lab. Tasks 4-5 must be finished by the usual deadline of Thursday 23:59.

Each student build their own project:
- Go from idea to a deployed product.
- Use agents and LLMs throughout.

----

#### Task 1 (graded by TA after the lab).
Pen and paper quiz.
- closed book, no devices allowed.
- you get random 3 questions from the question bank.
- answer at least 2 out of 3 correctly.

#### Task 2 (approved by TA during the lab).
The project idea must:
- Be something simple to build, clearly useful, and easy to explain;
- Involve backend + db + web dashboard + user-facing agent;
- Not be an LMS (different from the course project), however you can use the course project as the coding base to iterate from.

Define:
- End users of the product
- Which problem your product solves for the end users
- The product idea in one short sentence

The product must have these components each fulfilling a useful function:
- The nanobot agent
- Frontend
- Backend
- Database

> 🟪 **Note**
> `Telegram` bots deployed on a university VM can fail to receive messages when hosted there.

#### Task 3 (approved by TA during the lab).
Produce a plan including:
- prioritized requirements;
- a clear breakdown of requirements into three product phases.

Give priority to features that deliver the most value to end users and are easier to implement. Each phase should be a functioning product in itself.

#### Task 4.
- Implement your product with the core features.
- Publish all code as a repo on github.
- Dockerize all services.
- Deploy it to be accessible to use.

#### Task 5.
Submit presentation with five slides:

1. Title:
  - Product title
  - Your name
  - Your university email
  - Your group

2. Context:
  - Your end users
  - The problem of end users you are solving
  - Your solution

3. Implementation:
  - How you built the product

4. Demo:
  - Pre-recorded demo with live commentaries (no longer than 2 minutes)
  - _Note:_ This is the most important part of the presentation.

5. Links:
  - Link and QR code for each of these:
    - The GitHub repo with the product code
    - Deployed product

----

#### Publishing the product code on GitHub

- Publish the product code in a repository on `GitHub`.

  The repository name must be called `se-toolkit-hackathon`.

- Add the MIT license file to make your product open-source.

- Add `README.md` in the product repository.

  `README.md` structure:

  - Product name (as title)

  - One-line description

  - Demo:
    - A couple of relevant screenshots of the product

  - Product context:

    - End users
    - Problem that your product solves for end users
    - Your solution

  - Features:

    - Implemented and not not yet implemented features

  - Usage:

    - Explain how to use your product

  - Deployment:

    - Which OS the VM should run (you may assume `Ubuntu 24.04` like on your university VMs)
    - What should be installed on the VM
    - Step-by-step deployment instructions
